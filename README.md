# vim-typora

[Typora](https://www.typora.io/) is a wonderful themable markdown editor. But it does not have a vim mode.

## Usage

```
:Typora
```

to open the current file in Typora in Linux.

Saving text in Vim will automatically refresh Typora. After editing in Typora, use ```:e ``` to refresh the buffer in Vim. Or you can install the [WatchForChanges](https://github.com/djoshea/vim-autoread) vim plugin to load the buffer automatically.
